Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy (&quot;Policy&quot;). </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">By using the Service, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy, as such Policy may be amended from time to time. Each time you use the Service, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase &quot;Personal Information&quot; in this Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this personal information. When we use the phrase &quot;Anonymous Information&quot; in this Policy, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses. Anonymous Information does not necessarily enable identification of individual persons.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. Collection and Use of Information</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Eventy App</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">When you install the Eventy App and register, you will be asked to provide us with your phone number and to allow us access to your mobile device&#39;s address book. A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(a) notify you when your contacts become active on Eventy, </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(b) indicate which of your contacts is already a Eventy user, </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(c) correctly display the name of each contact as it appears in your address book when an event is created.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">In addition, we utilize a function that uses this data to synchronize your address book across your multiple devices.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a &quot;historical backup&quot;. If you delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Your phone number, which will be verified via a text message that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your Eventy user identification.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We are not responsible for any carrier charges that may apply when receiving any text messages while using Eventy. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Eventy also maintains Detailed Record for each Eventy event sent on the system. We maintain this information in order to better understand trends (numbers of events made by users, typical amount of invites sent, etc.), and technical issues and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Eventy may interact with your phone&#39;s SMS inbox, placing incoming messages in your inbox when sent or receiving invites for events. WE WILL NOT ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF ANY OTHER SMS.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Location Information</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Eventy allows you to attach your location information to events you send to other users. If you choose to share your location with a specific user or group of users your location will be retrieved from your device and sent to Eventy together with your event invite. Eventy will only use this location for this particular purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, Eventy will not share your location information and will not use it for any purpose except the one specifically requested by you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Cookies, Clear GIFs and Other Automatically Collected Data</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">If you have permitted your computer to accept cookies, we may use cookies on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual&#39;s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at the Site. Cookies may be used to analyze the Site usage, improve content, customize the Site&#39;s content and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Site. Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We may use &quot;clear GIFs&quot; (aka &quot;Web beacons&quot; or &quot;pixel tags&quot;) or similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual&#39;s viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Our servers may automatically collect data about your Internet address when you visit the Site. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Service. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We will not link any Personal Information, including e-mail addresses, with aggregate data of our users.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Any or all of these activities with regard to Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Third-Party Sites and Privacy Practices</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">You may arrive at our Site and/or download the Eventy App from another website. Websites linked to or from our application are not under the control of Eventy and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy. Our Policy applies solely to Personal Information that is acquired through your use of our Service, and/or your relationship with Eventy. We urge you to be careful when you enter any Personal Information online. We accept no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Analytics Collection</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Eventy uses Google Analytics to help us anonymously track and report user/visitor behavior information and users&#39; standard log information to the Eventy App. This information (including but not limited to: IP address, data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and information processing) helps us analyze and evaluate how the Eventy App is used as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the Eventy App along with it&rsquo;s features and services. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting. Google Analytics may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing these tasks and on behalf of Eventy and under obligation similar in those in this Privacy Policy. For more information about the terms that govern Google Analytics, please visit the </span><span class="c7 c3"><a class="c6" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics terms of service</a></span><span class="c3">. <br><br>We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personal Information of visitors or users. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a device user. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any Personally Identifiable Information from any source, unless you explicitly submit that information via a fill-in form on our website. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">We do not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties, except as specifically described herein. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our Service or members of the public.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">In order to provide you with Eventy products you have requested, Eventy may sometimes, if necessary, share your Personal Information (excluding your address book and related information) and traffic data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents, for example: banking organizations or other providers of payment and analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. Eventy will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. Eventy will never share your address book information with any third party, except as may be required by law (see below).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The following is a description of how we may share your Personal Information with trusted third party partners. Should we add additional partners, we will immediately update this description:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">1. We use a third party company in order to send you an authentication SMS when you register with Eventy. In order to send you the SMS, we send one of these third party companies your phone number and the authentication message. These third parties are contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the transmission of the authentication SMS.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">2. The same third party company is used in order to send non-users Eventy invites. The third party is obligated to only use your phone number for the transmission of the invite.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">3. We may use Push Notification Services to notify you about events and invites. If we do, the phone number or the name of the person inviting you may be part of the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to your device.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We may disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We may from time to time ask you to provide information about your experiences which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the Site or any survey that you accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Eventy software, products and websites.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We may contact you to send you messages about faults and service issues. Furthermore, we reserve the right to use email, the Eventy software or SMS to notify you of any eventual claims related to your use of our software, websites and/or products, including without limitation claims of violation of third party rights.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We may send you alerts via the Eventy software to notify you when someone has tried to contact you. We may also use the Eventy software to keep you up to date with news about our software and products that you have purchased and/or to inform you about other Eventy products and related information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. Children&#39;s Privacy</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Eventy websites and software clients are not intended for or designed to attract anyone under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information on our sites from anyone under the age of 13 (or older in some jurisdictions). We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission. We are not liable for any events created through the Eventy app.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. Security</span></p><p class="c5"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class="c3">We take reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although we cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect Personal Information. Personal Information is stored on our servers and protected by networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We are not liable if a user chooses to use an unprotected network. These can include (but are not limited to) networks found at a local library or coffee shop. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. Business Transitions</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. As part of such a transaction the new entity will be required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cannot obtain such a commitment, we will not perform the business transition.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We will post a notice on this Site of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information we may have prior to such transfer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">6. Changes to Policy</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">From time to time, we may revise this Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time with or without notice. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a way that is materially different than the uses described in this Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. We will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information we collect, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed. You agree to review the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site indicates your assent to any changes and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Site, the Eventy App, or any other Service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">7.
